# **Introducing MySQL**

## **Objective**
This manual will guide you through understanding what MySQL is, its client/server architecture, versions, and tools, ensuring they can effectively set up and use MySQL in the lab environment.

## **Step 1: Understanding MySQL**
1. **What is MySQL?**
   - **MySQL** is a **Database Management System (DBMS)** that stores, retrieves, manages, and manipulates data.
   - It is an **open-source** software, widely used worldwide due to its:
     - **Cost:** Usually free and open for modification.
     - **Performance:** Very fast and efficient.
     - **Trustworthiness:** Used by major organizations for critical data.
     - **Simplicity:** Easy to install and get started with.

2. **Why Choose MySQL?**
   - It is reliable, widely supported, and has a vast community.
   - It is suitable for a variety of applications, from small-scale websites to large enterprise systems.

## **Step 2: Client/Server Architecture of MySQL**
1. **Client/Server Model**
   - MySQL operates as a **client/server system**, where:
     - The **Server** handles all database operations (storing, retrieving, and manipulating data).
     - The **Client** interacts with the user and communicates requests to the server.

2. **Components of MySQL Client/Server Architecture**
   - **Server Software:** The MySQL DBMS which can be installed locally or on a remote server.
   - **Client Software:** Used to interact with the server. This can be:
     - MySQL Command-Line Utility
     - MySQL Workbench (Graphical User Interface)
     - Third-party clients like DBeaver, HeidiSQL, phpMyAdmin, or RazorSQL.

3. **How it Works**
   - Client software sends queries (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`) to the MySQL server.
   - The server processes these queries and returns the results to the client.
   - This interaction is seamless to the user, who never directly accesses the data files.

## **Step 3: MySQL Versions**
1. **Current Versions**
   - **MySQL Version 8** is the latest and most commonly used version.
   - **Version 5.7** is still in use in many organizations.
   - There was no **Version 7** as it was skipped.

2. **Compatibility and Updates**
   - Newer versions include more features and enhanced functionality.
   - Most concepts and commands in this guide are compatible with both Version 8 and Version 5.7.

---

## **Step 4: MySQL Tools**
### **1. mysql Command-Line Utility**
1. **What is it?**
   - A **command-line tool** that comes with every MySQL installation.
   - No graphical interface; commands are typed at the prompt.
   - It is reliable and always available as it is part of the core installation.

2. **Using the Command-Line Tool**
   - To start the utility, use:
     ```bash
     mysql --user=root --password
     ```
   - If not using the `root` user, replace `root` with your username.
   - You will be prompted for the password.
   - After login, you will see:
     ```
     Welcome to the MySQL monitor. Commands end with ; or \g.
     mysql>
     ```

3. **Basic Commands to Practice**
   - **Check MySQL Version:**
     ```sql
     SELECT VERSION();
     ```
   - **List Databases:**
     ```sql
     SHOW DATABASES;
     ```
   - **Select a Database:**
     ```sql
     USE database_name;
     ```
   - **List Tables in the Selected Database:**
     ```sql
     SHOW TABLES;
     ```
   - **Exit the Command Line:**
     ```sql
     quit;
     ```

### **2. MySQL Workbench**
1. **What is it?**
   - A **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for MySQL.
   - It allows users to:
     - Write and execute SQL queries.
     - View and manage database schemas.
     - Edit data and perform database administration tasks.

2. **Features and Benefits**
   - **Color-coded SQL Editor**: Helps in writing and debugging SQL statements.
   - **Results Display**: Query results are displayed in a grid format.
   - **Management Tools**: Allows checking server status, backup and restore functions.

3. **Installation and Setup**
   - MySQL Workbench may not be included with the MySQL installation.
   - Download it from the official site: [MySQL Workbench Download](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/).
   - It is available for **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.

4. **Basic Tasks in MySQL Workbench**
   - **Connect to the MySQL Server:**
     - Open MySQL Workbench and click on the **Local instance MySQL** connection.
     - Enter the **username** and **password** to connect.
   - **Create a New Database:**
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE db_lab;
     ```
   - **Select a Database:**
     ```sql
     USE db_lab;
     ```
   - **Create a Table:**
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE students (
         student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
         name VARCHAR(50),
         email VARCHAR(100)
     );
     ```
   - **Insert Data into the Table:**
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO students (student_id, name, email) 
     VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'alice@example.com');
     ```
   - **View Table Data:**
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM students;
     ```

### **3. Other Tools**
1. **Third-Party Clients**:
   - **DBeaver**: An open-source SQL client supporting multiple databases.
   - **HeidiSQL**: Lightweight client for Windows.
   - **phpMyAdmin**: Web-based MySQL client.
   - **RazorSQL**: Cross-platform database client with query builder.

2. **Why Use Third-Party Tools?**
   - Each tool has unique features and interfaces.
   - Useful for specific use cases like web-based management or cross-platform support.

## **Step 5: Hands-on Exercise**
1. **Objective:**
   - Practice using both **mysql Command-Line Utility** and **MySQL Workbench**.
   - Create a new database, add tables, insert data, and query the database.

2. **Tasks:**
   - **Install MySQL Workbench** from the [official site](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/).
   - **Connect to the local MySQL server** using both the command line and Workbench.
   - **Create a new database** named `db_lab_exercise`.
   - **Create a table** called `courses` with the following columns:
     ```
     course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
     course_name VARCHAR(100),
     instructor VARCHAR(50)
     ```
   - **Insert sample data** into the `courses` table.
   - **Query the data** to display all rows from the `courses` table.
